EVA4_Session_5_2

Added Batch Normalization and reduced parameters.
Target:
	1) Add Batch-norm to increase model efficiency.
Results:
	1) Parameters: 11070
	2) Best Test Accuracy: 99.24
Analysis:
We have started to see over-fitting now. 
Even if the model is pushed further, it won't be able to get to 99.4
